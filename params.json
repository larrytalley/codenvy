  "body": "### Codenvy Proof-of-Concept\r\nCodenvy is a multiuser development environment based on [Eclipse Che](https://eclipse.org/che/). This Codenvy proof-of-concept will implement a Vaadin-based web user interface that consumes services deployed via [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/), using [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/). \r\n\r\n### Why Codenvy\r\nThe problem we are trying to solve is that our developers support multiple projects or tasks, projects are implemented with a variety of technology stacks, and we spend too much time managing our development environments. We are hoping to demonstrate Codenvy customizable development environments per project or technology stack, composable, with a fully configured IDE customized for each project and sharable via a URL. Ideally a developer could be assigned to a project or task, given the IDE URL, and they could be committing code within an hour.\r\n\r\n### Proof-of-Concept Environments\r\nIn order to demonstrate that development environments can be customized per project or technology stack or task, we are demonstrating three independent environments:\r\n\r\n1) Vaadin UI development\r\n\r\n2) Services development\r\n\r\n3) ActiveMQ configuration\r\n\r\n",
